# DragonNet performance analysis under overlap violations

- This repository is part of the Research Project (CSE3300, Q4 2021/22) of the CSE bachelor at TU Delft. The other projects can be found at this [page](https://github.com/TU-Delft-CSE/Research-Project).

- The goal is to understand how well the [DragonNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02120.pdf) handles situations which have low overlap between treated and non-treated subpopulations.

- The "src" folder contains the new code used for testing the model under overlap violations during the Research Project. 
The IHDP samples used during the project can be found in the "ihdp_data" folder and can be used to reproduce the findings.  

- The "original_dragonnet_code" folder contains the DragonNet model described and implemented by
"[Adapting Neural Networks for the Estimation of Treatment Effects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02120.pdf)".
